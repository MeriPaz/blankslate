abstract = "Seagrass ecosystems are increasingly subjected to multiple interacting stressors, making the consequent trajectories difficult to predict. Here, we present a new process-based model of seagrass decline in response to cumulative light and temperature stress. The model is calibrated to laboratory datasets for Great Barrier Reef seagrasses using Bayesian inference. Our model, which is fit to both physiological and morphological data, supports the hypothesis that physiological carbon loss rate controls the shoot density decline rate of seagrasses. The model predicts the time to complete shoot loss, and a new, generalisable, cumulative stress index that indicates the potential seagrass shoot density decline based on the time period of cumulative stress. All model predictions include uncertainty estimates based on uncertainty in the model fit to the data. The calibrated model is packaged into a computer program that can forecast the potential declines of seagrasses due to cumulative light and temperature stress."

abstract = "Intensive agricultural practices represent a major threat to aquatic ecosystems because they impair water quality. However, this can be ameliorated by farmers improving crop management provided they are aware of their contribution to declining water quality. Water quality information systems can increase farmer awareness, but most were developed to assess water quality targets set in regulations rather than inform farmers. We developed the 1622WQ application using user-centred design principles to provide farmers with real-time information on nitrate and other contextual variables in their local creeks and rivers. The design process identified barriers to uptake of the application such as: (a) limited internet connection; (b) poor data quality; and (c) operational issues. Once these barriers were addressed, there was substantial uptake. Nevertheless, providing real-time information to farmers is only part of the solution due to legacy issues caused by a digital divide between traditional industries and those that are digitally enabled."
