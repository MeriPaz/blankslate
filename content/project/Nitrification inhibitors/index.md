To protect the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the Queensland government has set a target of 60% reduction in nitrogen discharge to the Reef by 2025. This project evaluates whether the use of a nitrification inhibitor coated fertiliser by farmers in GBR catchments can reduce nitrogen losses under tropical soils and climates, and help farmers achieve the water quality target.
